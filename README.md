### Master Service Agreement (MSA)

Preservation staff will coordinate actual quantities and scheduling of discrete work orders over the course of the contract.

* Each discrete work order is initiated by a scope of work; the corresponding Contractor quote must be approved and signed off on by the NYPL project coordinator (Preservation), with a purchase order generated prior to the commencement of work.

* The MSA is not a guarantee for work.
