## Section A: Overview

<a name="objectives"></a>
### Objectives

The Contractor will perform preservation reformatting work on magnetic and optical audio and video media from NYPL’s collections as part of NYPL’s strategic initiative to preserve the highest at-risk collections. Learn more about NYPL’s recent Mellon-funded Audio and Moving Image Collections, Facilities, and Workflows Assessment at www.nypl.org/preservation.

<a name="master-service-agreement-msa"></a>
### Master Service Agreement (MSA)

* The MSA will establish three-year contracts for ongoing work over the course of the contract.
Preservation staff will coordinate actual quantities and scheduling of discrete work orders over the course of the contract.

* Each discrete work order is initiated by a scope of work; the corresponding Contractor quote must be approved and signed off on by the NYPL project coordinator (Preservation), with a purchase order generated prior to the commencement of work.

* The MSA is not a guarantee for work.

<a name="specifications"></a>
### Specifications

* Specifications may be modified over time to reflect changes in best practices, in NYPL’s digital infrastructure, or to reflect previously unspecified media or conditions.

* For the most current and comprehensive specifications, including examples and tools developed by NYPL, see the following repositories under the NYPL GitHub space: https://github.com/NYPL   

  * Media file specifications, File Naming, structure and packaging of digital assets (https://github.com/NYPL/ami-specifications)

<a name="description-of-services"></a>
### Description of Services

The Contractor will provide preservation reformatting of audio and moving image media as described in this document.

**Work order lifecycle**

  * Stages
    * A statement of work is defined by NYPL and shared with selected Contractor.
    * Contractor provides a quote and agrees to schedule and specifications.
    * A purchase order is generated by NYPL.
    * Original media is shipped; work commences.
    * Contractor ships deliverables (digital assets).
    * NYPL performs quality control activities against the deliverables.
    * Invoices are approved following a successful pass of quality control.
    * Media is returned following successful completion of all work.

  * Quality control (QC)
    * NYPL quality control will be performed within 30 days of receipt of the digital assets.
    * NYPL will contact the Contractor immediately with QC issues.
    * Any re-work based on quality control will trigger a new QC cycle.
    * There may be unforeseen circumstances that prevent NYPL from completing quality control within the designated timeframe. NYPL will notify the Contractor of any conflicts.

  * Rehousing
    * The Contractor shall contact NYPL with a quote within three (3) business days following check-in of physical assets if it determines that the original quote was insufficient.

  * Special treatment
    * If any problems arise that warrant “special treatment” by the Contractor, the Contractor shall contact NYPL with a proposal and quote within three (3) business days.
    * Special treatment may be considered any work beyond the limits of the purchase order.
    * Special treatment shall not commence without written approval by NYPL (the work may require a new purchase order to be generated).

  * Rework
  	* If any problems are found that require re-transfer, the Contractor will perform this work for free (if re-transfer is possible) while they have possession of the original media.
  	* The Contractor shall immediately contact NYPL with a proposal if the media requires special handling for a re-transfer.
  	* The Contractor is responsible for rework of digital assets until the assets have passed NYPL quality control.

  * Retention of digital assets
  	* Contractor shall maintain all media files, checksums, and metadata for **60 days following NYPL’s quality control approval of all hard drives.**
  	* Immediately following this period, the Contractor shall provide confirmation of secure deletion of NYPL digital assets from the Contractor’s servers and backup storage.

**Deliverables - technical specifications**

  * Specifications may be modified over time to reflect changes in best practices or NYPL’s digital infrastructure, or to reflect previously unspecified media or conditions.

  * Digital assets must meet NYPL technical specifications (https://github.com/NYPL/ami-specifications)

**Supplies**
  * The Contractor is responsible for purchase of all supplies, including hard drives for delivery of the digital assets.
  * If supplies fees have not been articulated in the MSA contract, they must be approved by NYPL.
  * All fees shall be represented in the quote that corresponds to the statement of work; the vendor shall submit an invoice for reimbursement.
  
<a name="hard-drive-specifications"></a>
**Hard Drive Specifications**
  * All external storage devices must meet NYPL digital preservation requirements (https://github.com/NYPL/digpres-policies)

**Shipment of physical media**

  * Shipment of original physical media both to and from the Contractor shall be arranged by NYPL, using a shipper selected by NYPL.

  * NYPL shall be responsible for shipper fees.

  * Following successful quality control of the final digital assets covered by work order, NYPL will arrange return of the original media.

  * The Contractor shall re-pack original media in the original shipping containers.

  * Rehoused items
  	* If any original media has been rehoused, all components shall be packed together in the shipping container.
  	* If some components no longer fit as a result of rehousing, additional containers may be used.
  	* Original housings must be clearly associated with the rehoused materials.

  * Each shipping container must have a packing list.

**Shipment of digital assets (hard drives)**

  * The Contractor is responsible for shipping of hard drives.

  * NYPL must approve the method of shipment.

  * Shipping fees must be represented in the quote responding to the statement of work, and included on invoices for reimbursement.

  * The Contractor shall cover shipping fees that have been incurred due to failed quality control of a hard drive (failed hard drives returned to the Contractor, and corrected hard drives shipped to NYPL).

  * **Pilot File Delivery:** Before general production begins on a project, a shipment of "pilot" digital assets must be delivered as follows via FTP:

    * Contractor must provide FTP login information via email to NYPL project managers at the onset of a given project.
    * 5 completed Bags each of audio and video assets (10 bags total maximum)
    * Pilot shipment via FTP must be packaged within a directory that is given an identification number, and the FTP transfer must be listed on the associated invoice by its identifying shipment ID (NYPL will identify this shipment using the name of the directory as given by the vendor on their FTP client)
    * Once pilot assets are retrieved via FTP they will be reviewed in a timely manner by NYPL. Approved assets will be kept by NYPL and treated as progress deliverables (as the first shipment of a given project).

  * **Progress Shipments:** Subsequent progress shipments must be delivered via external hard drive; Hard drives shall follow an agreed-upon schedule for delivery - ideally shipped as they are filled, or as soon as 3-5 are ready for a batch shipment.
  	* NYPL wishes to avoid receiving shipments of more than 5 hard drives, which may hamper the ability to perform quality control in a timely manner.

**Off-site work or subcontracts**

  * All work shall be performed at the Contractor’s work site.

  * No Subcontractors shall be permitted to directly handle NYPL materials or perform work on NYPL projects unless explicitly approved by NYPL.

  * Environment
  	* When the materials are not being transferred, they will be stored in an environment that is free of food, water, sunlight, and strong magnetic fields.
  	* Temperature in the storage area will be between 45 - 65 degrees Fahrenheit.
  	* Relative humidity will be between 30% - 50%.

  * Inspection
  	* The Contractor will complete a thorough visual inspection before playback.

  * Special treatment
  	* If any physical problems are detected, either during inspection or playback that lead to special handling, the Contractor will contact NYPL with a proposed treatment plan before proceeding. No work may commence without written consent by NYPL.

  * Signal path
    * The Contractor will establish a reformatting signal path through selection, installation, and calibration of equipment designed to ensure optimal signal transfer.

**Contractor quality control processes**

  * The Contractor must perform quality control for all deliverables (including masters and service files); a similar process will be conducted by NYPL.

  * The Contractor should contact NYPL with any issues that may be resolved prior to shipping the digital assets.
    * For example, if the metadata is not accurate or does not validate, contact NYPL to resolve the issue so that valid metadata is delivered with the digital assets and does not hold up approvals processes.

  * The Contractor’s QC process should include:
    * Confirmation that all required files are present.
    * Filename conformance
    * Bag conformance
    * Checksum validation
    * File specification conformance
    * Metadata validity and accuracy (conformance to specifications and logical for the physical asset and related media)
    * Playback inspection of a minimum of 10% of preservation masters, which includes at a minimum one minute each at beginning, middle, and end of file (i.e., 3 minutes total per file).
    * NYPL may request greater quantities of item-level quality control if persistent issues are found.

**NYPL quality control processes**

  * NYPL quality control processes include:
    * Confirmation that all required files are present
    * Filename conformance
    * Bag conformance
    * Checksum validation
    * File specification conformance
    * Metadata validity and accuracy (conformance to specifications and logical for the physical asset and related media)
    * Playback inspection

  * If deliverables fail quality control and are determined to require rework, a new QC cycle begins following receipt of corrected assets.

  * The Contractor shall confirm that any issues discovered during NYPL quality control are not persistent issues across the deliverables.

<a name="rehousing"></a>
### Rehousing

**General information**

  * If any original material has been rehoused, the Contractor shall re-pack original materials into the original shipping containers.

  * If there is overflow due to rehousing, the related parts must be clearly described to allow NYPL to re-associate all parts. Media should be located in the original shipping container.

**Rehousing fees**

  * All costs for supplies and rehousing labor should be included with the cost proposal, as described in the Contractor’s fee schedule.

**Audio reel rehousing**

  * Reels should be re-boxed if the original box is damaging to the tape.

  * 3-inch and 5-inch reels
    * Transfer tape from 3-inch and 5-inch reels onto 7-inch reels, and place into a new 7-inch box.
    * NYPL may provide pre-labelled boxes.

  * 7-inch and 10.5-inch reels
    * Reels that are warped, broken, damaged, or on oversized/broadcast hubs should be replaced.
    * Reels that cause visible damage to the tape should be replaced.
    * Tapes stored on pancake hubs should be wound onto 10.5-inch standard NAB reels.
    * Tapes stored on AEG (Bobby) pancake hubs (Agfa brand tape) should be wound onto 10.5-inch standard NAB reels. If unable to properly play these hubs with the correct adapter, do not transfer: return to NYPL with appropriate documentation.
    * Do not transfer 7-inch reels onto 10.5-inch reels.

  * Slotless hubs are preferred, dependent on funds approval by NYPL. If slotless hubs are not commercially available, the Contractor should reuse the original reel and wind one-eighth inch of leader tape around the hub to minimize the effect of the slot.

  * If the original boxes are causing damage the reels, or if the tape has been re-wound onto a larger reel, original boxes may be replaced with new 2-piece boxes should be constructed of either white paper-board or unbuffered Ph-neutral lignen-free board. Do not substitute polypropylene or other plastic cases unless specifically requested by NYPL.

  * All new reels and boxes will be labeled with the item identifier provided in the metadata spreadsheet.

  * All original materials, including tapes, boxes, and reels will be returned to NYPL at the conclusion of the project.

**Audio grooved disc cleaning and rehousing**
#### Grooved disc rehousing
* All discs must be rehoused into acid-free and lignin-free buffered paper sleeves approved by NYPL.
  * If the disc is glass based, a piece of red tack down tape should be affixed below the class mark that should wrap around the envelope, making it visible once it is returned to its storage shelf. If the disc is damaged in some way (i.e.: cracked, broken, chipped, etc.) a piece of blue tack down tape should be placed below the red one in the same fashion.
* Barcodes must be duplicated and affixed to the upper-left hand corner of the new sleeve.
* Any IDs should be copied from the old sleeve to the new one in the upper right hand corner
* All original materials (including old sleeves) must be returned to NYPL at the conclusion of the project.

#### Grooved disc cleaning
Discs must be cleaned according to procedures appropriate for their base type, detailed below.  

##### Cleaning and rehousing of shellac, shellac-vinyl compound, and vinyl discs
* Cleaning and drying must be carried out with equipment suitable for archival discs.
* Clean each disc with a solution of distilled water and Photoflo 200 or 600, The Disc Doctor’s “Miracle Cleaner”, or comparable solution.

##### Cleaning and rehousing details for glass and aluminum based discs 
* Discs that appear to be relatively clean and in good condition may be cleaned using a standard archival disc-cleaning machine.
* Glass and Aluminum based discs which exhibit “Palmitic Acid Syndrome” must be hand-cleaned.
  * Aluminum discs: Oxidation may be gently wiped with mineral or castor oil and a lint-free cloth, prior to gentle hand-washing
  * Glass discs: Oxidation may be cleaned with a solution of non-scented detergent and PhotoFlo (or comparable product approved by NYPL)
  * Hand-wash with a solution of non-scented liquid soap and PhotoFlo; rinse with lukewarm water; repeat as needed on both sides; vacuum and dry discs as normal.
