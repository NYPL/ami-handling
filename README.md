# AMI Overview and Project Documentation

This document outlines shipping, handling, and reporting information related to NYPL's effort to preserve its at-risk media collections. For corressponding details about digital asset technical specifications, please see:

## Section A: Overview

### Objectives

The Contractor will perform preservation reformatting work on magnetic and optical audio and video media from NYPL’s collections as part of NYPL’s strategic initiative to preserve the highest at-risk collections. Learn more about NYPL’s recent Mellon-funded Audio and Moving Image Collections, Facilities, and Workflows Assessment at www.nypl.org/preservation. 

### Master Service Agreement (MSA)

* The MSA will establish three-year contracts for ongoing work over the course of the contract.
Preservation staff will coordinate actual quantities and scheduling of discrete work orders over the course of the contract.

* Each discrete work order is initiated by a scope of work; the corresponding Contractor quote must be approved and signed off on by the NYPL project coordinator (Preservation), with a purchase order generated prior to the commencement of work.

* The MSA is not a guarantee for work. 

### Specifications

* Specifications may be modified over time to reflect changes in best practices, in NYPL’s digital infrastructure, or to reflect previously unspecified media or conditions.

* For the most current and comprehensive specifications, including examples and tools developed by NYPL, see the following repositories under the NYPL GitHub space: https://github.com/NYPL   

  * Media file specifications, File Naming, structure and packaging of digital assets (https://github.com/NYPL/ami-specifications)
  * JSON specifications, controlled vocabulary, etc. (https://github.com/NYPL/ami-metadata)
  * JSON validation, MediaConch policies, etc. (https://github.com/NYPL/ami-tools)
  * External storage requirements (https://github.com/NYPL/digpres-policies)

* It is the Contractor’s responsibility to refer to the web page for most recent specifications.

* Specifications in place at the time of this document are attached in the Appendices.

### Description of Materials

* This master service agreement covers magnetic and optical audio and video media from NYPL research collections. 
  
  * See the known formats lists in Section B. 
  * Additional formats may be uncovered during the course of NYPL’s survey and inventory work. 

* The media is in varying states of condition, due to mechanical, chemical, or biological deterioration, or variable storage and handling practices. 

* The media may be under copyright or subject to restrictions. The Contractor shall only make copies of each item as specified in the statement of work. No other copying or distribution is authorized without NYPL written consent.

### Description of Services

The Contractor will provide preservation reformatting of audio and moving image media as described in this document. 

**Work order lifecycle**

  * Stages
    * A statement of work is defined by NYPL and shared with selected Contractor.
    * Contractor provides a quote and agrees to schedule and specifications.
    * A purchase order is generated by NYPL.
    * Original media is shipped; work commences.
    * Contractor ships deliverables (digital assets).
    * NYPL performs quality control activities against the deliverables.
    * Invoices are approved following a successful pass of quality control.
    * Media is returned following successful completion of all work.

  * Quality control (QC)
    * NYPL quality control will be performed within 30 days of receipt of the digital assets.
    * NYPL will contact the Contractor immediately with QC issues. 
    * Any re-work based on quality control will trigger a new QC cycle. 
    * There may be unforeseen circumstances that prevent NYPL from completing quality control within the designated timeframe. NYPL will notify the Contractor of any conflicts.

  * Rehousing
    * The Contractor shall contact NYPL with a quote within three (3) business days following check-in of physical assets if it determines that the original quote was insufficient.

  * Special treatment
    * If any problems arise that warrant “special treatment” by the Contractor, the Contractor shall contact NYPL with a proposal and quote within three (3) business days. 
    * Special treatment may be considered any work beyond the limits of the purchase order.
    * Special treatment shall not commence without written approval by NYPL (the work may require a new purchase order to be generated).

  * Rework
  	* If any problems are found that require re-transfer, the Contractor will perform this work for free (if re-transfer is possible) while they have possession of the original media.
  	* The Contractor shall immediately contact NYPL with a proposal if the media requires special handling for a re-transfer.
  	* The Contractor is responsible for rework of digital assets until the assets have passed NYPL quality control.

  * Retention of digital assets
  	* Contractor shall maintain all media files, checksums, and metadata for **60 days following NYPL’s quality control approval of all hard drives.**
  	* Immediately following this period, the Contractor shall provide confirmation of secure deletion of NYPL digital assets from the Contractor’s servers and backup storage.
	
**Deliverables - technical specifications**

  * Specifications may be modified over time to reflect changes in best practices or NYPL’s digital infrastructure, or to reflect previously unspecified media or conditions.

  * Digital assets must meet NYPL technical specifications (https://github.com/NYPL/ami-specifications)

  * All external storage devices must meet NYPL digital preservation requirements (https://github.com/NYPL/digpres-policies)

**Supplies**

  * The Contractor is responsible for purchase of all supplies, including hard drives for delivery of the digital assets.

  * If supplies fees have not been articulated in the MSA contract, they must be approved by NYPL.

  * All fees shall be represented in the quote that corresponds to the statement of work; the vendor shall submit an invoice for reimbursement.

**Shipment of physical media**

  * Shipment of original physical media both to and from the Contractor shall be arranged by NYPL, using a shipper selected by NYPL. 

  * NYPL shall be responsible for shipper fees.

  * Following successful quality control of the final digital assets covered by work order, NYPL will arrange return of the original media.

  * The Contractor shall re-pack original media in the original shipping containers. 

  * Rehoused items
  	* If any original media has been rehoused, all components shall be packed together in the shipping container. 
  	* If some components no longer fit as a result of rehousing, additional containers may be used.
  	* Original housings must be clearly associated with the rehoused materials.

  * Each shipping container must have a packing list.

**Shipment of digital assets (hard drives)**

  * The Contractor is responsible for shipping of hard drives.

  * NYPL must approve the method of shipment.

  * Shipping fees must be represented in the quote responding to the statement of work, and included on invoices for reimbursement.

  * The Contractor shall cover shipping fees that have been incurred due to failed quality control of a hard drive (failed hard drives returned to the Contractor, and corrected hard drives shipped to NYPL).

  * A pilot hard drive containing at least 10 fully completed bags should be delivered immediately, subject to a comprehensive review by NYPL, with feedback and resolution as needed. 
     * Pilot drives will not be considered deliverables. All digital objects provided on Pilot drives must be re-delivered on subsequent drives.
     * NYPL will return the pilot drive following feedback, so that the pilot drive may be reused.

  * Subsequent hard drives shall follow an agreed-upon schedule for delivery: ideally shipped as they are filled, or as soon as 3-5 are ready for a batch shipment.
  	* NYPL wishes to avoid large influxes of hard drives, which may hamper the ability to perform quality control in a timely manner.

**Off-site work or subcontracts**

  * All work shall be performed at the Contractor’s work site. 
  
  * No Subcontractors shall be permitted to directly handle NYPL materials or perform work on NYPL projects unless explicitly approved by NYPL. 

### Project administration
